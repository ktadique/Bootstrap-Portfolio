[Kirsten T. //Web Developer](https://ktadique.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/) is my portfolio website showcasing my UX and Bootstrap framework knowledge.

I had tried to make my portfolio as similar in both looks and functionality as my previous portfolio, using all the relevant bootstrap components as necessary.
